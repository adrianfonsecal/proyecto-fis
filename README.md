# Space project (FIS)
This is the space where we will be modifying our software engineering fundamentals proyect.


# File-list software project
You can't find your files after you saved them, or you don't know how to name them, or you want to save them in a folder? So if one of these questions were true you need to use our software "File-List".

File-List is a software students first proyect where we pretend to help you out saving your importante files in the best way possible.

# The problem
The problem detected in the student and office community is the mishandling of files prior to and after their storage. Until now it was only considered a problem, but it was not formally documented, so we decided to prepare a survey where we visualized the following results (The complete results of said survey are in the results section of the questionnaire):

52.3% of the respondents define that they have had problems finding a document after saving it, and 93.1% of the surveyed population mention that they know someone who happens to lose their documents after saving them. 73.9% do not know how to name their files to save them.

Given what was previously evaluated in the survey, 91.3% of the population considers that a program that helps them with the organization of their files can be a good alternative to help them solve their problem or that of their acquaintances. 

# Objetive of our software proyect
Organize in a clear, orderly and efficient way the documents and files of a user as required by means of a software system as an extension to their file explorer.
1. Systematize the user's document search processes through the software interface. 
2. Safeguard user files by easily syncing with the world's most influential clouds. 

# Work team
Our work team is conformed by 6 students of the first semester of software engineering career.

# First part of the project
## Results of the questionnaire 
First we had to know some things about people behavior related on how they save their files in their computer, so we decided to create a questionnaire and those are the results (The questionnaire were pretty usuful at defining the problem in population, and after that we decided to prepare this project):
[Questionnaire](https://github.com/adrianfonsecal/proyecto-fis/blob/Entrega1/RESPUESTAS%20DEL%20CUESTONARIO.pdf)

## The description of the app
In this document as it's called we describe all the general parts of the software project. 
* [Document](https://github.com/adrianfonsecal/proyecto-fis/blob/Entrega1/Fila1.md)

## Requirements and user stories 
In this part of the project we described and considered the functional requirements and the non functional requirements, and with a diagram we exemplified it.
* [Document](https://github.com/adrianfonsecal/proyecto-fis/blob/Entrega1/Fila2.md)

## Development process
With the help of the log, we record all the processes that occurred throughout this first part of the project, from the responsibilities to the agreements reached in the sessions are recorded here. 
* [Document](https://github.com/adrianfonsecal/proyecto-fis/blob/Entrega1/Fila3.md)

## Subject competencies
Here are the arguments of how we relate the process in a software project and what we learned during the virtual classes.

# Second part of the project (changes, advances and refinement)
Now we're coming with the advances of the project. We modified some things in the requirements and in the process of design with add some new things.

## Sumaries
### Summary of the progress
What we change in this new part of the project in explained in the next document.
* [Summary of the progress](https://github.com/adrianfonsecal/proyecto-fis/blob/Entrega2/Summaries.md)

### Summary of the product
Also we made changes in the project related to the product, and we explain in the next document what me improve.
* [Summary of the product](https://github.com/adrianfonsecal/proyecto-fis/blob/Entrega2/SummaryProduct.md)

## Refinement of the requirements, user stories and use case diagram
We had to make some changes in the requirements process due to they were not very clear and also we added some new requirements, also the user stories were improved, so the use case diagram change in order to be better unterstood.
* [Document (Refinement)](https://github.com/adrianfonsecal/proyecto-fis/blob/Entrega2/Requirements%20and%20user%20stories(Refinement).md)

### Requirements prioritization 
The requirements were ordered in a new document, called  prioritization of the requirements, because in the design phase we needed an inidicator that  would provide which of all the requirements are most importants for the project and should be included in the disegn document and in the first versions of the test phase.

## Imagotype
With this piece of the project me make a new sense into the product. This is the image of the product.
