# The problem
The problem detected in the student and office community is the mishandling of files prior to and after their storage. Until now it was only considered a problem, but it was not formally documented, so we decided to prepare a survey where we visualized the following results (The complete results of said survey are in the results section of the questionnaire):

52.3% of the respondents define that they have had problems finding a document after saving it, and 93.1% of the surveyed population mention that they know someone who happens to lose their documents after saving them. 73.9% do not know how to name their files to save them.

Given what was previously evaluated in the survey, 91.3% of the population considers that a program that helps them with the organization of their files can be a good alternative to help them solve their problem or that of their acquaintances. 

# Objetive of our software proyect
Organize in a clear, orderly and efficient way the documents and files of a user as required by means of a software system as an extension to their file explorer.
1. Systematize the user's document search processes through the software interface. 
2. Safeguard user files by easily syncing with the world's most influential clouds. 

# Work team
Our work team is conformed by 6 students of the first semester of software engineering career.

# First part of the project
## Results of the questionnaire 
First we had to know some things about people behavior related on how they save their files in their computer, so we decided to create a questionnaire and those are the results (The questionnaire were pretty usuful at defining the problem in population, and after that we decided to prepare this project):
[Questionnaire](https://github.com/adrianfonsecal/proyecto-fis/blob/Entrega1/RESPUESTAS%20DEL%20CUESTONARIO.pdf)

## The description of the app
In this document as it's called we describe all the general parts of the software project. 
* [Document](https://github.com/adrianfonsecal/proyecto-fis/blob/Entrega1/Fila1.md)

## Requirements and user stories 
In this part of the project we described and considered the functional requirements and the non functional requirements, and with a diagram we exemplified it.
* [Document](https://github.com/adrianfonsecal/proyecto-fis/blob/Entrega1/Fila2.md)

## Development process
With the help of the log, we record all the processes that occurred throughout this first part of the project, from the responsibilities to the agreements reached in the sessions are recorded here. 
* [Document](https://github.com/adrianfonsecal/proyecto-fis/blob/Entrega1/Fila3.md)

## Subject competencies
Here are the arguments of how we relate the process in a software project and what we learned during the virtual classes.

# Second part of the project (changes, advances and refinement)
Now we're coming with the advances of the project. We modified some things in the requirements and in the process of design with add some new things.

## Sumaries
### Summary of the progress
What we change in this new part of the project in explained in the next document.
* [Summary of the progress](https://github.com/adrianfonsecal/proyecto-fis/blob/Entrega2/Summaries.md)

### Summary of the product
Also we made changes in the project related to the product, and we explain in the next document what me improve.
* [Summary of the product](https://github.com/adrianfonsecal/proyecto-fis/blob/Entrega2/SummaryProduct.md)

## Refinement of the requirements, user stories and use case diagram
We had to make some changes in the requirements process due to they were not very clear and also we added some new requirements, also the user stories were improved, so the use case diagram change in order to be better unterstood.
* [Document (Refinement)](https://github.com/adrianfonsecal/proyecto-fis/blob/Entrega2/Requirements%20and%20user%20stories(Refinement).md)

### Requirements prioritization 
The requirements were ordered in a new document, called  prioritization of the requirements, because in the design phase we needed an inidicator that  would provide which of all the requirements are most importants for the project and should be included in the disegn document and in the first versions of the test phase.
* [Document](https://github.com/adrianfonsecal/proyecto-fis/blob/Melhem/Lista%20de%20prioridad%20de%20requerimientos.docx)

## How does the software product have to named the files?
In this part of the design phase, we decided to create this new document to have a notion of how the software product have to named all the files that are going to be related to this SW. Here is included how is going to be named the files and the folders, to have an order in our visualization.

## Imagotype
With this piece of the project me make a new sense into the product. This is the image of the product.

## Requirements resolution mapping for the design phase 
We made some new document to explain how does the requirements need to be solved in the design phase for later be applied in the simulation of the software in its first versions.
