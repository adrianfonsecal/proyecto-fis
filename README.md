# 1st Space project
This is the space where we will be modifying our software engineering fundamentals project.

# File list project
You can't find your files after you saved them, or you don't know how to name them, or you want to save them in a folder? So if one of these questions were true you need to use our software "File-List".

File-List is a software students first proyect where we pretend to help you out saving your importante files in the best way possible.

# Objetive of the our software proyect
Organize in a clear, orderly and efficient way the documents and files of a user as required by means of a software system as an extension to their file explorer.
1. Systematize the user's document search processes through the software interface. 
2. Safeguard user files by easily syncing with the world's most influential clouds. 

# Work team
Our work team is conformed by 6 students of the first semester of software engineering career.
1. Alvarado Interián, Rubén Enrique
2. Berzunza Ramirez, Melhem Abraham
3. Caamal Dzib, Adal Jefte
4. Fonseca Loría, Adrián
