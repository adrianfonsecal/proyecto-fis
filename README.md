# The problem
The problem detected in the student and office community is the mishandling of files prior to and after their storage. Until now it was only considered a problem, but it was not formally documented, so we decided to prepare a survey where we visualized the following results (The complete results of said survey are in the results section of the questionnaire):

52.3% of the respondents define that they have had problems finding a document after saving it, and 93.1% of the surveyed population mention that they know someone who happens to lose their documents after saving them. 73.9% do not know how to name their files to save them.

Given what was previously evaluated in the survey, 91.3% of the population considers that a program that helps them with the organization of their files can be a good alternative to help them solve their problem or that of their acquaintances. 

# Objetives of the proyect
Organize in a clear, orderly and efficient way the documents and files of a user as required by means of a software system as an extension to their file explorer.
1. Systematize the user's document search processes through the software interface. 
2. Safeguard user files by easily syncing with the world's most influential clouds.

# The project
In order to have a better organization we decided to divide the project in pieces, so in the future new developers and people who is interested can understand our project just reading all the documents.
