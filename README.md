# 1st Space project
This is the space where we will be modifying our software engineering fundamentals project.

# File-list software project
You can't find your files after you saved them, or you don't know how to name them, or you want to save them in a folder? So if one of these questions were true you need to use our software "File-List".

File-List is a software students first proyect where we pretend to help you out saving your importante files in the best way possible.

# Objetive of our software proyect
Organize in a clear, orderly and efficient way the documents and files of a user as required by means of a software system as an extension to their file explorer.
1. Systematize the user's document search processes through the software interface. 
2. Safeguard user files by easily syncing with the world's most influential clouds. 

# Work team

# First part of the project

## The description of the app
In this document as it's called we describe all the general parts of the software project.

## Requirements and user stories 
In this part of the project we described and considered the functional requirements and the non functional requirements, and with a diagram we exemplified it.

## Development process
With the help of the log, we record all the processes that occurred throughout this first part of the project, from the responsibilities to the agreements reached in the sessions are recorded here.

## subject competencies
Here are the arguments of how we relate the process in a software project and what we learned during the virtual classes.
