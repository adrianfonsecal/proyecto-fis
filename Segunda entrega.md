# Second part
Now we're coming with the advances of the project. We modified some things in the requirements and in the process of design with add some new things.

## Sumaries
### Summary of the progress
What we change in this new part of the project in explained in the next document.

### Summary of the product
Also we made changes in the project related to the product, and we explain in the next document what me improve.

## Refinement of the requirements, user stories and use case diagram
We had to make some changes in the requirements process due to they were not very clear and also we added some new requirements, also the user stories were improved, so the use case diagram change in order to be better unterstood.

### Requirements prioritization 
The requirements were ordered in a new document, called  prioritization of the requirements, because in the design phase we needed an inidicator that  would provide which of all the requirements are most importants for the project and should be included in the disegn document and in the first versions of the test phase.

## How does the software product have to named the files?
In this part of the design phase, we decided to create this new document to have a notion of how the software product have to named all the files that are going to be related to this SW. Here is included how is going to be named the files and the folders, to have an order in our visualization.

## Imagotype
With this piece of the project me make a new sense into the product. This is the image of the product.

## Requirements resolution mapping for the design phase 
We made some new document to explain how does the requirements need to be solved in the design phase for later be applied in the simulation of the software in its first versions.
